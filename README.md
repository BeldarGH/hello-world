Repositorio cero de pruebas

Hello there!!! 

I am a Master student of Computer Engineering (MUIINF) at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV, Spain)
This repository will hang my work related to programming science and learned in this Master.
You are free to download my work, but if you get an economic benefit, I want my 10%!

See you!
